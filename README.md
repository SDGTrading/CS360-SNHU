Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

      This app was designed to allow users to set a goal weight, input daily weight, and track their weight gain/loss through a simple, easy to read chart.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

      In order to support the necessary features the application includes a home screen, settings, weight tracking, and input weight options. The UI design was kept simple and plain in order to reduce the time user's spend on the application each day. It is intended to be a quick way for users to track weight daily without interrupting their daily activities.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

      When coding this application I focused on readablility and best practices. As the application is fairly basic I wanted it to be easily maintained and updated for features that may be added in the future. Going forward I will continue to focus on following best practices when coding.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

      Through Android Studio I tested each feature in the application to ensure it was working correctly. Testing did not reveal any issues within the application, but is important due to the possiblility of broken functionality or leaking user information if the application is not secure.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

      During development I did not run into any challenges, however I did enjoy being able to create a UI with any settings or theme I wanted to use.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

      I feel that the UI design was successful as I was able to keep it minimal in order to reduce screen time for users. This application can be a quick 30 second update each day that does not interupt the user's day, and can still be monetized to produce revenue.
